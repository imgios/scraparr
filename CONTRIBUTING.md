# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [issue](https://github.com/imgios/scraparr/issues), email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Branch naming convention

| Instance | Branch Name | Description |
|----------|:-----------:|-------------|
| Stable | `main` | Accepts merges from Working and Hotfixes |
| Working | `dev` | Accepts merges from Features/Issues and Hotfixes |
| Feature/Issue | `feat/feature-name` or `fix/bug-name` | Always branch off HEAD of Working |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/hotfix-name` | Always branch off Stable |

## Conventional Commits

As a general rule, your commit message should start with a single line that's no more than about 50 characters and that describes the commit concisely. If you feel the need for more detailed explanations, create a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation.

The [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history.

You're not obliged to use the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), but it's important to have a clear commit message. In this case, for consistency, try and use the imperative present tense when creating a message. Examples:

- Use "Add tests for" instead of "I added tests for"
- Use "Change x to y" instead of "Changed x to y"

## Merge Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies/values are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes e.g., new parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Merge Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Merge Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

> Be careful, do not squash multiple commits into one, we prefer to have the full commit history of our codebase.
